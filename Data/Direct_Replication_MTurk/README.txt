The "Codebook for Nelson Replication" in this folder was made for a clean version of this dataset. I don't know where the clean version went, but between the IRB and the codebook, you should be able to figure out the meaning of the variable codes:

Specifically, the order of the variables in the columns in the raw data correspond to the order of the questions in the survey as described in the IRB document.
The codebook will tell you what the values of the dummy codes are (e.g., What would you estimate your household income to be? = 6 = $50,000-$74,999)
