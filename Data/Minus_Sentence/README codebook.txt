This raw dataset (Nelson_R2_editing) R2 = "Round 2" makes two changes to the original Nelson design: 

1) it removes the instruction that primes respondents to think that there is a 'right' and 'wrong' answer. 
2) it increases the respondent sample size to increasea statistical power in the analyses.

The event prompts are still the same as in the original design, so the balance of behavior-deflecting and object-deflecting events is still off; they are still underrepresented among the questions.

The order of the columns in the trainer (Q1 thru Q10) are the same as in all the other versions of the study.
Q112 is an attention check. It checks to see if respondents understand what they're supposed to do in the survey. In the first wave of data (collected July 9), we didn't have an attention check and I noticed a lower quality of data, so I added one for next time. (this change wasn't updated in the IRB protocol, unfortunately)
